#you can hoe, then go back to normal with pickaxe
-find something with hoe
-when there is 6 hoed spots, go to the left until you're
above the starting spot
-do the pattern 4 times
-repeat pattern 1 spot above where you started 
---that's a full rotation
-then 3 spots to the right of the first spot

--if there's an object blocking a spot that you need to hoe,
hoe a different spot and it'll skip that spot and you can continue with the pattern, same with hoeing wrong spot
