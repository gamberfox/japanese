はばたいたら戻らないと言って

"はばたいたら" (habataitara) is the conditional form 
of the verb "はばたく" (habataku), which means "to flap" 
or "to flutter" (referring to wings).

"戻らない" (modoranai) is the negative form of 
the verb "戻る" (modoru), which means "to return."

"と言って" (to itte) means "they say" or "it is said."

So, the phrase suggests a proverbial or metaphorical
 meaning. It conveys the idea that once a certain 
action or decision is taken 
(like spreading one's wings and flying), 
there is no turning back. It implies that there may 
be irreversible consequences to certain choices or 
actions, and one should be prepared for the outcomes 
of their decisions.


The phrase "目指したのは青いあの空" (mezashita no wa aoi ano sora)
translates to "What I aimed for is that blue sky" in English.

"目指した" (mezashita) is the past tense of the verb "目指す"
(mezasu), which means "to aim for" or "to target."

"のは" (no wa) is a particle that indicates the topic
of the sentence.

"青い" (aoi) means "blue."

"あの" (ano) is a demonstrative pronoun meaning "that."
"空" (sora) means "sky."
So, the phrase indicates that the speaker's goal or
aspiration was to reach or achieve that beautiful blue sky. 
It can be interpreted as a poetic expression about someone's
 dreams, hopes, or ambitions, and the longing to reach a distant,
 metaphorical "blue sky" as a symbol of their desired 
destination or achievement.
