はばたいたら戻らないと言って
"はばたいたら" (habataitara) is the conditional form 
of the verb "はばたく" (habataku), which means "to flap" 
or "to flutter" (referring to wings).

"戻らない" (modoranai) is the negative form of 
the verb "戻る" (modoru), which means "to return."

"と言って" (to itte) means "they say" or "it is said."

So, the phrase suggests a proverbial or metaphorical
 meaning. It conveys the idea that once a certain 
action or decision is taken 
(like spreading one's wings and flying), 
there is no turning back. It implies that there may 
be irreversible consequences to certain choices or 
actions, and one should be prepared for the outcomes 
of their decisions.
